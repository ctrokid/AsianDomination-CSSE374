Runzi & Collin added Dot utils.

01/05/2015
All members pair programmed the rest of the implementation and test.


Instruction of Running Code:
In order to generate a PDF of code, user needs to go to DesignParser class and add all classes that should be included for the UML in CLASSES string array. User can also name the names of output files in MAIN under asmOutputPath and dotOutputPath. The very last line of DesignParser class launch the Dot application and generate the UML PDF. Once the classes ran, the PDF can be accessed under input_output folder.
